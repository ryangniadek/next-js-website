I like computer systems, infrastructure, DevOps, and software engineering.

I work as a Solutions Architect at [Celonis](https://www.celonis.com), responsible for the technical onboarding experience of our customers. Previously, I was a Software Consultant at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) leading customer projects to transform their IT automation practices.

My undergraduate degree is in [Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu) from [Virginia Tech](https://eng.vt.edu). I am still involved with the college as a board member on the Young Alumni Council for the College of Engineering. I was appointed to a four-year term in 2024.

This is my website where you can see more information about me, check out my projects, and read my blog posts.
